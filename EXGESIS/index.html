<p>The roots of the fascist narrative go back to late 19th century sciences of
biology and anthropology. Science fiction and fascism share both a structure
and a source. While H.G.Wells was writing his evolutionary fantasies,
The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds and The Island of Dr Moreau,
the discourse of evolution was producing its own monsters, eugenics and
Social Darwinism.</p>

<p>Since the mid-19th century man was increasingly seen not as a spiritual
being but as a biological entity. Science - evolutionary biology, racial anthropology,
physiology and the study of heredity - focused on a range of
physical and supposedly mental differences among various human groups
and in the process splintered humanity into a number of racially defined
species. As a paradoxical consequence of Darwinism, which proved man's
continuity with the animal world, biological discontinuities and rifts appeared
within humanity itself. Late 19th century eugenics spawned a discourse
of exclusion, which placed "inferior" groups beyond the pale of
traditional morality because moral laws apply to human beings and these
creatures were not seen as human.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, historians and cultural scholars have extensively researched the importance of science in the genesis of fascism. "National Socialism is nothing but applied biology," said Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy, claiming for science the privileged status in the Nazi Welschtauung. Despite the reluctance to accept such statements at face value, fuelled by what Mario Bagioli calls our "essentially positive view of science," historical evidence is inescapable (qtd. in Friedlander 185). Robert Jay Lifton calls the Nazi state a "biocracy." In his important book on racial hygiene, Robert Proctor states that his focus is not on the putative Nazi "destruction" of science but precisely on the way in which "the ideological structure we associate with National Socialism was deeply embedded in the philosophy and institutional structure of German biomedical science long before the beginning of euthanasia project in 1939 - and, to a certain extent, even before 1933" (6). Other scholars who have made similar claims include Lerner, Muller-Hill, Michael Burleigh and Ian Kershaw, and many others.</p>

<p>Eugenics has been thoroughly discredited, partly through the aversion generated by the Nazi crimes. But the temptation to hypostasize biological differences within humanity into an immutable typology is alive and well, reflected in the excesses of sociobiology and the apocalyptic giddiness of the Human Genome Project. Goldhagen believes that anybody who accepts a fascist world-view is thereby cast out from the light of Western civilization - hence his most controversial claim that the Weimar Germans were not like "ourselves" (28). Their "cognitive frameworks" appear to us, heirs of the Enlightenment, as "fantastic," "hallucinatory," or plain weird. But while the fascist cognitive framework can no longer claim kinship with the mainstream of biology, Goldhagen exaggerates both the uniformity of science and the power of consensus.</p>

<p>Members of the Christian Identity movement in the United States believe that "Jews are the physical descendants of a sexual union between 'Mother Eve' and 'the serpent"' (Abanes 162). Lest the uninitiated be tempted to consider this as some sort of allegory, Richard Abanes quotes the Aryan Nation's statement of belief which emphasizes the word "literal": Jews are "literal children of Satan in the world today" (162). Blacks and other non-whites, on the other hand, are "mud people," descendants of the flawed races God had created before finally achieving perfect humanity in the persons of (white) Adam and Eve. The Christian Identity, apparently, has a mythology of a quite bewildering complexity, which Michael Barkun, who wrote a book on the movement, compares to early Gnostic heresies. The main pillar of this mythology is the conviction that Jews "are the direct biological offspring of the Devil" (Barkun 149; emphasis added). The Jews are "shape-changers, a generic form of evil with multiple manifestations" (184).</p>

<p>Of course, this creed is exotic, to say the least. But if even a smalgroup believes shape-changers walk the streets of New York, perhaps thedifference between "us" and those deluded Germans is not as great asGoldhagen claims.</p>

<p>Unlike Nazism, the Christian Identity makes use of homegrown Biblical fundamentalism. But science is not completely absent even from theIdentity's novel exegesis of the Gospels, while other white supremacist groups reject the Bible altogether, relying on the biological discourse indistinguishable from Hitler's.</p></p>
