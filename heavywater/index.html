        <p>In the catholic faith, it is believed that touching a piece of cloth, often with a dot of the supplicant’s blood, to a first class relic (A part of a saint’s body or something Christ touched) bestows to that cloth some of the power of that relic. These so-called third class relics are often encased in beautiful baubles of glass and gold. St Anthony’s chapel in Troy Hill is full of these fragments, collected from many different first class relics. This transference of holiness is not limited to religious ephemera. Any subject that flirts with the sublime is bound to play in this arena of transference. The cloistered archiving of Warhol’s boxes of junk, e-girl bathwater, certificates of star ownership, NFTs. The promise here is that a small amount of the sublime can be minted and distributed to “democratize” it.

        <p>This magical thinking and false democratization is also central to AI. As of the writing of this statement, OpenAI is valued at five hundred billion dollars<a href="https://observer.com/2025/10/sam-altman-openai-500b-valuation/">1</a>. Nvidia currently has a market capitalization of 4.5 trillion dollars<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/nvidias-market-cap-tops-4point5-trillion-on-ai-infrastructure-deals.html?msockid=095257ec67f860fc07ea416a669861e1">2</a>. For some context, the entire global pharmaceutical industry has an estimated value of 1.7 trillion dollars<a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/pharmaceutical-market">3</a>. This valuation is completely speculative, as not a single AI product on the market has made a cent of profit. All of this is based on the presumed future value of a machine that costs 10 more times energy than a google search<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435123003653#bib9">4</a>, is built on a mountain of stolen artwork<a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2023/05/15/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-theft-245283/">5</a>, and has to be guarded from telling children to make chlorine gas<a href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-bleach-vinegar">6</a>.  Every promise to make a tool to supercharge human creativity<a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/spotify-ai-music-tools-plan-major-label-partnerships/">7</a> is in fact another way to disenfranchise artists<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24294995/spotify-ai-fake-albums-scam-distributors-metadata">8</a>. In addition, data centers like the ones that currently run these models account for 4.4% of the US’s energy consumption and millions of gallons of fresh water, most of which is evaporated to cool the computers<a href="https://insidetechworld.com/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-water-consumption-and-environmental-impact/">9</a>. These numbers are expected to double by 2028 just because of AI<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/">10</a>. These tools take your questions, grind them into tokens, then into weights, then into encodings, and back out in the form of a dubious answer and energy released as steam. Truly a modern miracle of transubstantiation.</p>

        <p>Fluxus artists Mieko Shiomi and Ben Patterson also made works that transformed the sublime into water. Shiomi produced many editions of Water Music, water that had been imbued with some ineffable quality of music played near it. Through our archival research, we found detailed documentation of Patterson’s Dr. Ben’s Fluxus Medicine Show, a project later in the artist’s life where he produced boxes of Fluxus Elixir, “irradiated with special acoustic frequencies to cure the sufferers with mental obstacles to value and understand contemporary art.” As with much of the work associated with the Fluxus movement, these playful projects throw the fine art world’s rarified air back in its face while ironically producing more collectible ephemera.</p>

        <p>This project was created in collaboration with Cash Ragona, Peggy Ahwesh, Dom Jebbia and Bo Powers with funding from Carnegie Mellon's AIxArts Research Incubator Fund</p>
